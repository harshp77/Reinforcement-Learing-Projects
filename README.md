# Reinforcement-Learing-Projects

## Mission

This Repo contains some of the projects completed while learning Reinforcement Learning.

## Build instructions

This Repo contains Ipynib formats of files which can we be localy runed with

1. Get the basic libraries using the pip commands some of which contains 
 - Gym
 - Matplot

2. Run it either via anaconda or windows Powershell using `python -m notebook`
3. Let the kernel load and run all cells or edit it however u like :)
